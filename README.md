# About The Project
The Freiburg Groceries
Dataset is a dataset consisting of 4,947 256x256 RGB
images covering 25 different classes of groceries, with at
least 97 images per class. Images are collected from real-world settings at different stores and apartments. In contrast to existing groceries datasets,
dataset includes a large variety of perspectives, lighting conditions, and degrees of clutter. 
All models are made with image rescaling to 150x150(x3) due to hardware limitations. The CNN architectures used are: vgg16, alexNet, resNet. 
All ipynb files are almost identical but contain different models and were added to display different model results.
